#Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
#Matthew Jorden
#December 2016

This is my final code project for the Coursera course Getting and Cleaning Data. This Github repository contains my R script to satisy the project goals.

#Running the Code

To run the code you must have the following packages installed:
*plyr
*dplyr
I wrote and ran the code in R 3.3.0

Simply download the script and the accompanying data and run the script (with necesarry packages installed). You can get the data used here:
